        <p class="dist-intro"> 
            Widely heralded as the Rice Granary of Kerala, Palakkad
            is the treasure trove of astounding sights and the Gateway to Kerala
            from North. The place is a melting-pot of culture, history, art, literature,
            folklore and ethnic denominations, because of the invasions from the
            bordering kingdoms in the past. Palakkad gap, the biggest mountain pass
            in the Western Ghats, separate Kerala and Tamilnadu. The proximity of
            Tamilnadu is well reflected in the food culture, festivals and dialects of
            Palakkad.
            The swaying palmyra trees, the extensive paddy fields and the mountains
            of the Sahya Range are the prime icons of this picturesque district.
            Credited with a number of sightseeing options like forts, rivers, hills,
            forests, dams, wildlife sanctuaries, waterfalls, temples and heritage spots,
            Palakkad is an ideal destination to enlarge the vistas of your journeys.

        <h3>POTHUNDI DAM</h3>
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            Unwind yourself in the magic spell of nature
            in a Dam site. Pothundi Dam is constructed in
            the 19th Century across the Meenichiladipuzha
            and Padipuzha rivers in the Pothundi village in
            Palakkad. It provides water for irrigation to an area
            of 5,470 hectares and supplies drinking water to
            the surrounding places. This dam is one of the
            oldest ones in India and a main stopover on the
            way to the Nelliyampathy Hill Station.
            The unique feature of the dam is the entire
            structure was built using boulders and, the core
            wall of the dam is built by the mixture of jaggery
            and quicklime. No cement, iron or steel are
            used there and yet, the dam is very strong still.
            A perfect blend of engineering and architecture
            can be seen there. It’s a treat for your eyes to view
            the stunning Nelliyampathy Hills on one side and
            acres of green paddy fields on the other side of
            the dam.
            You can also visit a small beautiful garden over
            there. It will be an amazing experience if you visit
            the dam and reservoir during the monsoon season.
            A famous festival called Nenmara Vallangi Vela is
            held on the shores of the reservoir. The tranquil
            water along with the hills in the backdrop will
            surely make your mind and body reinvigorated.
