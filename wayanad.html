    <h1>WAYANAD</h1>
    <div class="intro">
       
        <p class="dist-intro">
            Wayanad is among the most beloved treasures of God's Own Country and here it is that its eponymous wildlife sanctuary was set up in 1973. These are located in the southern trenches of the famous Western Ghats, ranked 8th in the list of the World's Biodiversity Hotspots. The landscape usually consists of hilly terrains interspersed with dense valleys, which have helped build its reputation as one among the most picturesque natural sites in the whole world.

            The Wayanad Wildlife Division as an administrative unit has 344.53 km2 of Wildlife Sanctuary area, comprising two discontinuous units of 266.77 km2 and 77.76 km2 respectively. It covers the Wayanad Plateau (about 3000 km2) situated at the confluence of three biologically distinct and diverse regions- the main Western Ghat Mountains, the Nilgiri Hills and the Deccan Plateau. The plateau area is mostly located in Kerala, with small parts in the neighbouring states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

            The plateau extends from Kerala and slopes gently eastwards towards the Deccan Plateau. The protected areas here share their boundaries with the protected area network of Nagarhole and Bandipur Tiger Reserves of Karnataka in the northeast and Mudumalai Tiger Reserve of Tamil Nadu in the southeast. These four contiguous protected areas have a total area of 2,184 km2.

            The sanctuary is a component of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (5,520 km2) and of the Elephant Reserve No. 7 of South India. Kuruma, Paniya, Kattunaicka, Urali, Kurichiar and Adiyar are some of the tribal communities that inhabit this area

        <h3>Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary</h3>
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            This area is renowned with having world's largest recorded population of Asian Elephants and Tigers. Both of these species, along with the Vulture, are considered the flagship species of the Sanctuary. To this, we add Leopards, Jungle Cats, Leopard cats, spotted deer, Sambar deer, Gaur, Sloth bear, Wild dog, Wild boar, Indian pangolin, Stripe-necked mongoose and plethora of other mammals.

            Its location plays a huge role in its importance to the local ecology, as it shares its borders with the other protected areas of Bandipur and Nagarhole Tiger Reserve in North-East side and Mudumalai Tiger Reserve of Tamil Nadu in the south-eastern side. These offer a natural corridor for the seasonal migration of animals.

        <h3>Edakkal Caves </h3>

        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            Edakkal Caves are two natural caves at a remote location at Edakkal, 25 km from Kalpetta in the Wayanad district of Kerala in India's Western Ghats. They lie 1,200 m above sea level on Ambukutty Mala, near an ancient trade route connecting the high mountains of Mysore to the ports of the Malabar coast. Inside the caves are pictorial writings believed to date to at least 6,000 BCE, from the Neolithic man, indicating the presence of a prehistoric settlement in this region. The Stone Age carvings of Edakkal are rare and are the only known examples from South India besides those of Shenthurini, Kollam also in Kerala. The cave paintings of Shenthurini forests in Kerala are of the Mesolithic era. This makes the Edakkal and Shenthurini river valley civilizations older than the Indus Valley civilizations

        <h3>Soochipara Waterfalls</h3>
    
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            Soochipara Falls also known as Sentinel Rock Waterfalls is a three-tiered waterfall in Vellarimala, Wayanad, India. It is surrounded by deciduous, evergreen and montane forests. Locally referred to as Soochipara, the 15-20 minute drive from Meppadi to Sentinel Rock Waterfalls has views of a number of Wayanad's tea estates. The Sentinel Rock Waterfalls is 200 metres and offers a cliff face that is used for rock climbing. The water from Soochipara Falls later joins Chulika River or popularly known as Chaliyar River after Velarimala Hills near Cherambadi in Kerala. Once people reach the parking area, they have to pass through a security check at the entrance where they make sure you don't carry any plastic. It takes 10-15 minutes walk to the waterfalls and water flow is less during summer, which makes it easy to reach the rocks where water falls
