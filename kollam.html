    <h1>KOLLAM</h1>
    <div class="intro">
       
        <p class="dist-intro">
            Kollam is the nerve-centre of the country’s cashew trading and processing industry. The cashew
industry in Kollam boasts of a legacy of a
century of cashew nut export. It was in 1920 that the
first batch of cashews was exported from the country, from
Kollam to the USA. History has it that it was in the same year that
the first factory was set up in Kollam to start the commercial processing of
cashew nuts. What began as a small scale industry grew in leaps and bounds and
Kollam is now a major trade centre for cashew in the country. Cashew continues to be
exported to countries such as the USA, the UK, Netherlands, the UAE, France, Canada,
Italy, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Japan and so on. Kollam is the ideal place to see the
cashew industry at close quarters and take home good quality dry fruit. </p>

        <h3>KOLLAM BEACH</h3>
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            With its glorious stretch of golden sand and azure waters, Kollam
beach is the quintessential beach destination for travellers. The magnificent
Arabian Sea that stretches unendingly to
the horizon makes for a beautiful, dreamy
sight. Aesthetics apart, this beach has its
share of archaic grandeur too.
It was once a major centre of trade when it was a busy, active harbour that attracted Chinese
ships. You can see remnants of the glorious past in the form of Chinese fishing nets, Chinese
water pots, and sampans. The place is important considering the maritime history of Kerala,
and once you are here, you can embark on a cultural and historical journey into the past.
If, on the other hand, observing and understanding the local lifestyle is your choice, walk along
the coast and explore the nearby fishing hamlets for a taste of the present. If entertainment is
your priority, Kollam beach is rich in that department too. An array of beach activities are on
offer here. The park near the beach offers many thrilling rides for kids. Also known as Mahatma Gandhi Beach, it is frequented by locals and foreigners alike

        <h3>SHENDURNEY WILDLIFE SANCTUARY</h3>

        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            Shendurney Wildlife Sanctuary,
            the only wildlife sanctuary in
            Kollam, is part of the Agasthyamala
            Biosphere Reserve. The sanctuary owes
            its name to the endemic plant species,
            Gluta travancorica, locally known as
            Cherukurinji. Situated on the southern part
            of the Western Ghats, this sanctuary is set amidst luxurious greenery, and is acclaimed
            for its rich biodiversity. The terrain is mostly covered by tropical evergreen and semievergreen forests. The endangered Lion-tailed Macaque can be seen in these
            forests. The rare Great Eared Nightjar has also been spotted here. Idimuzhanganpara,
            Pallivasal, Rockwood, Kurunthottivalavu, and Lake View and Kalamkunnu are the five
            camping sites in the sanctuary

        <h3>JATAYUPARA</h3>
    
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            Jatayupara is a hillock in
Chadayamangalam, Kollam that
features a stunningly colossal statue
of Jatayu. Popular belief has it that the
vulture-king mentioned in the epic
Ramayana fell on this rocky hill when Ravana
sliced off its wing during an aerial combat as
Jatayu tried to prevent the abduction of Sita. Considered the world’s largest bird sculpture, it has a rock theme park and an adventure centre for sports enthusiasts. The 60 ft.
tall, 150 ft. broad and 200 ft. long figure of the fallen bird stands as a symbol of valour
and sacrifice. The Jatayu Earth’s Center offers a bird’s eye view from 1000 ft. above sea
level.
