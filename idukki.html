        <p class="dist-intro">
            Hike the uncharted trails. Make new acquaintances among friendly locals. Find
your calling in the mist-veiled highlands. Idukki, the landlocked district in eastern
Kerala, is one of the most favoured tourist destinations in South India. A plethora of experiences awaits you in these unfathomed foothills of Western Ghats.
Apart from the much-vaunted destinations such as Munnar and Thekkady, numerous destinations have emerged as favourites among the travel fraternity
in the past couple of decades. Panchalimedu, Meesapulimala, Amappara and
Vagamon are a few of the places of interest.
Idukki is home to diverse endangered species including the Bengal Tiger and
Nilgiri Tahr. The Periyar Tiger Reserve and the Eravikulam National Park are also
located in Idukki.
Often called the spice garden of Kerala, Idukki is one of the greenest regions in
the state. Let the cool mountain air fill-in your senses. Discover a new aroma in
the boundless spice plantations. Behold the spellbinding view of purple-blue
Neelakurinji flowers covering the Nilgiri every 12 years. </p>

        <h3>MEESAPULIMALA</h3>
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            Considered one of the best treks in Kerala, Meesapulimala is a Shangri-la for
            hikers. The peak bears a resemblance to a tiger and its whisker and hence the
            name Meesapulimala, derived from the local language. Resting at an altitude of
            2,640 m, Meesapulimala is one of the highest peaks in Kerala.
            If nature is your thing, you’re in for a treat. The trail is much like a Rousseau
            painting coming to life. Chase the wild butterflies to the abyss, stroll along with
            the myriad rhododendron trees, toss your worries into the isle of clouds. You
            can even get some local company on the way, like the Wild Gaur or the Nilgiri
            Tahr. Sambar Deer and Sloth Bears have also been spotted in the area.

        <h3>ARUVIKKUZHI</h3>
    
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            The wind feels less friendly, but we are not offended. For she has grown weary,
blowing between bohemian customs and magnificent cultures. But before this
fateful reunion, a dip in the Aruvikkuzhi waterfall plunging 1000 m down makes
her a little calm and serene to our wonderment. On her way up the mountain,
the sandalwood trees grant her a luxurious scent that stirs one’s soul like no
other. Is this what it feels like to be in heaven?
Aruvikkuzhi waterfall is one of the less explored destinations in Idukki.
‘Aruvi’ in the local language translates as ‘stream’. Loosely dubbed as the
stream that falls into the pit, Aruvikkuzhi waterfall can be best explored
from Aruvikkuzhi Viewpoint. One of the notable features of the viewpoint IDUKKI 4
is that it is set on both sides of a stream flowing down the mountains with
a bridge to separate them. To enter the viewpoint, a charge of Rs. 20 is
levied for adults and Rs. 10 for children. The numerous brick walkways
that zigzag along the park lead you to many scenic places with magnificent
views and comfortable relaxing huts
