        <p class="dist-intro">
            Kochi, arguably the most famous part of Ernakulam district,
was the centre of trade during ancient times. The port city,
which emerged in the 14th century, played a key role in the
historic spice route trade. It has been the hub of spices of all
kinds since then. Arab, Greek, Jewish, Chinese and Roman
traders would frequent the route to Kochi. Ancient travellers
and traders used to gush about this port city, which was
always the sought-after destination for foreign traders. Even
with its cosmopolitan nature, the city still exudes an ancient
charm, its cultural heritage attracting travellers from around
the world. The extensive stretch of backwaters of this port city
continues to awe travellers. At Kochi, you see a hodgepodge of
cultures and traditions co-existing with ease </p>

        <h3>FORT KOCHI</h3>
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            Fort Kochi (View Video) is a cultural vessel shaped
by many historical influences, the traces of which can still
be found in its very streets. Portuguese, Dutch and British
influences are evident in the Indo-European architecture
of the buildings dotting this town.
A prime example of this is Fort Immanuel, a Portuguese
bastion built in 1503 to mark the strategic alliance
between the Maharaja of Cochin and the Portuguese
monarch. The Dutch cemetery near the beach was built in
the Dutch style of architecture of those times. Consecrated
in 1724, the cemetery carries the remains of
hundreds of people of Dutch and British
nationality. It is currently managed by the
Church of South India (CSI)
