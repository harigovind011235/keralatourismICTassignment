    <h1>KANNUR</h1>
    <div class="intro">
       
        <p class="dist-intro"> 
            Kannur was a part of the Chera kingdom, a dynasty that
            reigned in many regions of Kerala. The Kolathiri Rajas
            made Kannur their capital in the early centuries. The
            district is also home to the only Muslim royal dynasty in
            Kerala. During the British rule, Kannur put up a strong fight
            that was violent and long drawn. Today, the district thrives
            as a tourism destination, drawing in fascinated crowds
            from far and wide for its folk art rituals, temples, forts and
            numerous scenic destinations. 
            Kannur is most renowned for the Theyyam performances in its temples. This magnificent art form plays an integral part in the culture of this Northern Kerala district. Formerly known as Cannanore, Marco Polo christened it a ‘Great Emporium Of Spice Trade’. Kannur has, since time immemorial, been hailed as an influential sea port. Legend has it that it had interactions and trade relations with the rest of the world since the time of King Solomon to the Greeks, Arabs and Romans. It has a plethora of forts, temples, beaches and wildlife sanctuaries that regularly attract visitors. Major festivals and events are held throughout the year and this is among the best places in Kerala to spend your vacation in.

        <h3>St. Angelo’s Fort</h3>
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            St. Angelo’s Fort is a symbol of Kerala’s colonial past, built in 1505
            by Don Francesco de Almeida, the First Portuguese Viceroy in
            India. The fort was built with the permission of the local Kolathiri
            king. Soon after, Almeida decided to turn the wooden fort into
            one made of stone which was completed in 1507. Also known
            as Kannur Fort, the imposing triangular laterite fort that is now
            a preserved monument under the Department of Archaeology
            has borne witness to many conflicts
            The fort has changed hands many times, first being taken
            over by the Dutch in 1663. It then underwent a revamp,
            with the addition of three bastions Hollandia, Frieslandia
            and Zeelandia that are now its most prominent feature.
            The fort was purchased by the Arakkal dynasty’s Ali Raja in
            1772. In 1790, the British laid claim to the historic site, seizing
            it from the Beevi of Arakkal to make it their main garrison
            till 1947. The fort overlooks the Arabian Sea, neighbouring
            the Mopilla Bay Harbour, a natural fishing bay, and Arakkal
            mosque. The fort, with its moat, ammunition dumps,
            tunnels, underground jails and sturdy bastions, was a
            formidable base making it a much sought-after structure
            by settlers through the ages.

        <h3>Arakkal Kettu Museum </h3>

        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            The Arakkal Kottaram or palace, better known as Arakkal Kettu,
            has the distinction of being the ancestral house of the only
            Muslim royal family in Kerala. The Arakkal Ali Rajas, as the male
            rulers were addressed, and in the case of women in power,
            Beevis, once ruled Kannur, the southern parts of Lakshadweep
            and Minicoy. While the palace building in itself has unassuming
            exteriors, glimpses of another era reveal themselves in the
            artefacts and heirloom inside the Durbar Hall which has been
            converted into the museum.
            The museum is maintained by the Arakkal family.
            The palace which functioned as the administrative
            headquarters of the royal family was used as the office
            of the collector of Malabar until the Department of
            Archaeology began to maintain the building. The palace
            has an architectural style that blends traditional and
            colonial influences. Long verandahs lead to the palace
            which is made of laterite and wood. The two-storeyed
            main building has wooden floors and stained glass
            windows that envelope the large halls in a kaleidoscope
            of light during the day. The large kettu or courtyard
            distinct to traditional houses in Kerala is surrounded by
            independent units that used to house the administrative
            office and mosques. One of the blocks that is considered
            sacred has a lamp that is kept lit, known as Kedavilakku,
            all day. On display are a pathayam (used for storing
            grains in the olden days), the family seal, copies of the
            Holy Koran, swords, daggers, a telescopand other items
            that were used by the royal members

        <h3>Thalassery Fort</h3>
    
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
        Thalassery used to be an important trading hub during the
        days of colonial reign. From spices to timber, the small town
        saw a lot of trading due to its strategic location close to the sea.
        The fort was built by the East India Company in 1703 to protect
        their trading activities after differences with local chieftains
        led to disputes. The Company had grown into a formidable
        settlement on the Malabar Coast by 1683. 
        The fort was seen as an added measure of protection.
        The presence of the French in Mahe, just 5 km south of
        Thalassery, provoked the British to establish their military
        stronghold in the region with the fort serving as the base,
        especially from 1776 to 1784. The walls of the fort rise to an
        astonishing 10 m. The bastions offer a view of the sea to
        watch out for any invasions. There is a lighthouse in the
        fort premises. Post independence, the fort was used by the
        government for their many offices. Now it is maintained
        by the Department of Archaeology. With its large walls,
        intricate woodwork on the doors and secret tunnels, the
        fort makes for a fascinating day of explorations.
