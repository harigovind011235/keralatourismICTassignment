    <h1>THRISSUR</h1>
    <div class="intro">
       
        <p class="dist-intro">
            Think Thrissur and it is caparisoned elephants, colourful parasols and the beat of a
            thousand percussion instruments that come to mind. But the Thrissur Pooram is just one
            element that reflects the district’s vibrant glory. The city has always played an active part,
            be it in trade relations during the ancient and medieval times, later during the period of
            colonial rule, to its prosperity under Sakthan Thampuran who was to change Thrissur’s
            destiny forever under his effective leadership. Thrissur in its current layout, centred
            around the Shiva temple Vadakkumnathan and the Thekkinkad Maidan or square ground
            around which the rest of the city took shape under Shakthan Thampuran, has progressed
            immensely since. Much has happened in the intermittent periods with a lot of action
            brewing politically. But today, the district continues to thrive as the cultural capital of
            Kerala and is also increasingly becoming a place that leading entrepreneurs hail from.
            Thrissur is a tourist’s paradise offering a bouquet of cultural adventures only made better
            by the warmth of its friendly people </p>

        <h3>ATHIRAPPILLY
            WATERFALLS</h3>
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            Athirappilly Waterfalls is a mesmerising sight to the beholder. At 80 ft., it is the
            largest waterfall in Kerala and is also known as the Niagara of India (in case trivia
            interests you). Located in Thrissur’s Chalakudy district, the Chalakudy river flows
            towards Athirappilly from where it cascades down the enormous height to form
            the breathtaking view. The river has its origins in the Anamudi mountains of the
            Western Ghats, where the Sholayar ranges begin. It flows with increased force as
            it approaches Athirappilly where it then divides into three falls. Athirappilly has
            many specialties owing to its nature-endowed richness. Over the years, the falls
            have become a part of the backdrop for numerous movies. The monsoons are a
            time when the falls are most visited by tourists. The Vazhachal falls close by is also
            a favourite spot for picnickers. The dense forest is home to the Indian elephant,
            Indian leopard, Bengal tiger and many other species of animals. At an elevation
            of 50ft, the Athirappilly-Vazhachal riparian forest hosts all the four South Indian
            species of hornbill including the state bird, the Great Hornbill. It is an ‘Important
            Bird Area’ according to the International Bird Association while The Wildlife Trust of
            India calls it India’s best elephant conservation effort. The picturesque drive from
            Chalakudy to Athirappilly is a sign of what awaits at the falls, as the landscape
            covers several small villages and winding roads. The falls are especially a sight
            during the monsoons when visitors are greeted by a gentle mist of water rising
            from the falls.

        <h3>VAZHACHAL</h3>

        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            Vazhachal Falls is a must-visit destination if one is in Thrissur. A popular tourist
attraction just like its neighbour the majestic Athirappilly Falls, Vazhachal also
lies in the Athirappilly panchayat. Vazhachal Falls is 5 km from Athirappilly. The
Chalakudy river meets Vazhachal from its place of origin in the Anamudi ranges. A
permit is required from the Kerala Forest check post which opens at 6 am to enter
the area of Vazhachal Falls. If you have purchased a ticket at Athirappilly Falls that
should suffice. Vazhachal Falls is located towards the end of the Sholayar ranges,
coursing through the midst of the lush green forests on either side. At 390 feet,
the sight is captivating, to say the least. The Western Ghats are on display in their
magnificent beauty and might as the falls adorn them in a slanting gush of water.
The areas surrounding the falls are calmer and so make for ideal picnic spots.
Visitors are warned to avoid walking through the water as the rocks are slippery
and any accidents can be dangerous to say the least. Forest guards stand vigil
around the area. Bird watchers can never get enough of the winged inhabitants
of the region which is also known for its endemic species. The monsoon or cooler
months from June to September are ideal to visit the falls as they flow at their
highest intensity. It is an experience that onlookers will find humbling and thrilling
all at the same time.

        <h3>THUMBOORMUZHI</h3>
    
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            By far the most popular destination in Thrissur, Thumboormuzhi has many places
of interest for tourists. The Thumboormuzhi Dam, a delightful Butterfly Park, a
hanging bridge that offers a scenic view and a children’s park make it a fun getaway.
An hour and a half away from Thrissur city, Thumboormuzhi Dam holds pride of
place across the Chalakudy river. The dam provides water to nearby villages for
irrigation purposes. The hanging bridge presents a wider view of the dam and the
forests surrounding it, apart from the river beneath the bridge which reveals its
bed in the hotter months and the butterfly park on one side. At the end of the
hanging bridge is Prakriti Gramam in Ezhattumukham which is a part of Ernakulam.
The monsoons are when Thumboormuzhi is more exciting as the river will be in
full flow. The area attracts many species of flora and fauna that thrive. Butterflies
of several species in vibrant colours and sizes that will leave visitors gaping make
the park an unforgettable experience. It is also home to many kinds of plants that
lure the butterflies. The children’s park is ideal for little visitors to have fun while
an embankment allows swimming, there is also a snack bar and DTPC restaurant,
washrooms and a parking area which make Thumboormuzhi the perfect holiday
for family fun
