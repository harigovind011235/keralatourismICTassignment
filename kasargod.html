    <h1>KASARGOD</h1>
    <div class="intro">
       
        <p class="dist-intro"> 
            Kasaragod is often described as the land of forts and gods. The place is noted
            for its ritual dance Theyyam, an art that blends dance, myth, drama, music,
            art and theatrics. A performing art popular in the northern districts of Kerala,
            Theyyam can be enjoyed in all its glory at Kasaragod.
            In Theyyam, the performer is considered as a medium between the supernatural
            and the mortal worlds. The Theyyam season gifts one with a grand visual treat
            as different Theyyams take centre stage and perform the ancient art. Listen to
            the many lores at Kasaragod, a land known for festivals, folk and visual art.
            Yakshagana is one of the popular Indian theatre forms performed in Kasaragod in
            Kerala and the South Canara districts of Karnataka. The art form is characterised
            by extravagant costumes, elaborate make-up and unique stage techniques. The
            stories are mostly based on episodes taken from epics like the Ramayana and
            the Mahabharatha.
            Yakshagana cannot be described as an exclusive folk, classical or rural art form
            since it incorporates elements of all these in its narration and performance. The
            art form involves dance, music and dialogues. Yakshagana literally translates to
            ‘the music of celestial beings,’ and the narration is accompanied by background
            music played using percussion instruments. The singers and artistes perform in
            sync with it to create this celestial musical drama.
            Kasaragod is almost synonymous with the magnificent key-hole shaped fort, the
            Bekal Fort which is a historic structure. Other forts include the Chandragiri Fort,
            Hosdurg Fort, Kumbala Fort, Povval Fort, Kundamkuzhi Fort and Bandadukka Fort.

        <h3>BEKAL FORT</h3>
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            Bekal Fort (View Video) in Kasaragod holds a unique place in the history of
            Kerala. The fort, facing the Arabian Sea, was built purely for defence purposes,
            and is one among the biggest forts in Kerala.
            The walls of the Bekal Fort, which
            is a few centuries old, are made of
            laterite and are about 12 m in height.
            The fort has witnessed many fierce
            battles both human and natural, and its
            continued existence is a testimony to the
            engineering brilliance of those times.
            Near the fort stands an Anjaneya Temple
            and a mosque that testify the religious
            harmony that once prevailed in the region.

            RANIPURAM
        </h3>

        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>

            Ranipuram hills stand at a height of 750 m above
            sea level, and is the region of highest altitude in the
            district. Once known as Madathumala, Ranipuram is a
            paradise for trekkers and Nature lovers who are drawn
            by the evergreen Shola woods, sprawling meadows and
            monsoon forests. Wild elephants can also be spotted
            wandering in the mountains.
            To reach Ranipuram, one must take a bus from
            Kanhangad to Pananthady, and hire a jeep from there.
            The District Tourism Promotion Council has arranged
            cottages for tourists.

        <h3>CHANDRAGIRI FORT</h3>
    
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            The ruins of Chandragiri Fort stand at the confluence
        of the Payaswini river and the Arabian Sea on the
        south-eastern side of Kasaragod town. The Chandragiri
        Fort, one among a chain of forts perched atop a hill, was
        built in the 17th century by Sivappa Naik of Bedanore.
        The ruined fort is about 46 m above sea level, and
        covers an area of seven acres. The incessantly flowing
        river and the estuary where the river meets the sea
        are visible from the fort, which is now managed by the
        Department of Archaeology, Govt. of Kerala.
        The ancient Kizhur Sastha Temple and a mosque are
        also situated near the fort.
