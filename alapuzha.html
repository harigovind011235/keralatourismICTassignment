        <h3>Ambalapuzha Sree Krishna Temple</h3>

        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            The temple is an old architectural splendor and is spread over a huge area with a large pond. The temple has two gates of entry the Eastern & Western Gate. The Western Gate has lot of shops & adequate parking. The temple is famous for the " Ambalapuzzha Palpayasam ( Rice Kheer/ Rice Pudding)", which is distributed at 12 noon. The Palpayasam needs to be pre-booked or if you are lucky you can stand in queue at 10:30 am and try and get it on the same day. The temple also has a elephant permanently inside the temple premises. It is believed that Sree Guruvayoor Appan ( Deity at Guruvayoor Temple) visits the temple every day noon for the "Ambalapuzzha Palpayasam".

Please Note :- Due to the present COVID-19 situation, entry only through Western Gate is allowed. Children are though allowed inside the temple premises but entry into the main sanctum sanctorum.

        <h3>Alappuzha Lighthouse</h3>
    
        <div class="detail-desc">
        <p>
            At 100 rupees for foreigners this is a must see if visiting the area there’s a little museum at the side with some interesting memorabilia in it but it’s the lighthouse itself that’s the star here it’s quite a step climb up a narrow wooden staircase that you do barefoot as inside any building in India the last 10 steps are up a near vertical metal ladder but once outside the views are amazing
Please note you do need to be reasonably fit for this attraction
